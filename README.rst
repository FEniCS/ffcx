FFC-X is a new version of the FEniCS Form Compiler. It is being actively
developed and is compatible with DOLFIN-X.

FFC-X is a compiler for finite element variational forms. From a
high-level description of the form in the Unified Form Language (UFL),
it generates efficient low-level C code that can be used to assemble the
corresponding discrete operator (tensor). In particular, a bilinear form
may be assembled into a matrix and a linear form may be assembled into a
vector.  FFCX may be used either from the command line (by invoking the
``ffcx`` command) or as a Python module (``import ffcx``).

FFC-X is part of the FEniCS Project. For more information, visit
