To install FFCx, type

    pip install --prefix=/path/to/install/ .

This will install FFCx in the default Python path of your system,
something like /path/to/install/lib/python3.6/site-packages/.

To specify C++ compiler and/or compiler flags used for compiling UFC
and JITing, set environment variables CXX, CXXFLAGS respectively
before invoking setup.py.

The installation script requires the Python module distutils, which
for Debian users is available with the python-dev package.  Other
dependencies are listed in the file README.

For detailed installation instructions, see the FFCx user manual which
is available on http://fenicsproject.org/ and also in the subdirectory
doc/manual/ of this source tree.
