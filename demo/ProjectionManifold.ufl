# Define interval embedded in 3D:
domain = Cell("triangle", geometric_dimension=3)

# Define element over this domain
V = FiniteElement("RT", domain, 1)
Q = FiniteElement("DG", domain, 0)
element = V*Q

(u, p) = TrialFunctions(element)
(v, q) = TestFunctions(element)

a = (inner(u, v) + div(u)*q + div(v)*p)*dx
