# The bilinear form a(u, v) and linear form L(v) for
# Biharmonic equation in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
# formulation.
#
# Compile this form with FFC: ffcx Biharmonic.ufl

# Elements
element = FiniteElement("Lagrange", triangle, 2)

# Trial and test functions
u = TrialFunction(element)
v = TestFunction(element)

# Facet normal, mesh size and right-hand side
n = FacetNormal(triangle)
h = 2.0*Circumradius(triangle)
f = Coefficient(element)

# Compute average of mesh size
h_avg = (h('+') + h('-'))/2.0

# Parameters
alpha = Constant(triangle)

# Bilinear form
a = inner(div(grad(u)), div(grad(v)))*dx \
  - inner(jump(grad(u), n), avg(div(grad(v))))*dS \
  - inner(avg(div(grad(u))), jump(grad(v), n))*dS \
  + alpha/h_avg*inner(jump(grad(u),n), jump(grad(v),n))*dS

# Linear form
L = f*v*dx
