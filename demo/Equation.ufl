# Specification of a system F(u, v) = 0 and extraction of
# the bilinear and linear forms a and L for the left- and
# right-hand sides:
#
#   F(u, v) = a(u, v) - L(v) = 0
#
# The example below demonstrates the specification of the
# linear system for a cG(1)/Crank-Nicholson time step for
# the heat equation.
#
# The below formulation is equivalent to writing
#
#  a = u*v*dx + 0.5*k*inner(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
#  L = u0*v*dx - 0.5*k*inner(grad(u0), grad(v))*dx
#
# but instead of manually shuffling terms not including
# the unknown u to the right-hand side, all terms may
# be listed on one line and left- and right-hand sides
# extracted by lhs() and rhs().
#
