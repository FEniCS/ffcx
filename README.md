# FFCx: The FEniCSx Form Compiler

FFCx is a new version of the FEniCS Form Compiler. It is being actively
developed and is compatible with DOLFINx.

FFCx is a compiler for finite element variational forms. From a
high-level description of the form in the Unified Form Language (UFL),
it generates efficient low-level C code that can be used to assemble the
corresponding discrete operator (tensor). In particular, a bilinear form
may be assembled into a matrix and a linear form may be assembled into a
vector.  FFCx may be used either from the command line (by invoking the
`ffcx` command) or as a Python module (`import ffcx`).

FFCx is part of the FEniCS Project. For more information, visit

## Installation

To install FFCx from PyPI:
```
$ pip install ffcx
```

To install FFCx from the source directory:
```
$ pip install .
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be viewed at https://docs.fenicsproject.org/ffcx/main


## Interface file installation only

FFCx provides the `ufcx.h` interface header for finite element kernels,
used by DOLFINx. `ufcx.h` is installed by FFCx within the Python site
packages, but it is sometimes helpful to install only the header file.
This can be done using `cmake`:
```
$ cmake -B build-dir -S cmake/
$ cmake --build build-dir
$ cmake --install build-dir
```
